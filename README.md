# Learn To Code by Oliver Pan

I created this repository to help students learn to code. I will be consistently updating it and providing resources whenever I can. I have a strong belief that anyone can code, and if you put your heart to it, and have a desire to learn, you'll be very successful in this coding journey. Please feel free to fork this repository and contribute!

**Why did I create this repo?**

A lot of the time, I get the question, "how do I learn to code"? Many of my peers feel that they cannot code, and won't ever be able to . That is not true. ANYONE CAN CODE, and you have to be willing to take the time and learn. Everyone starts from somewhere!

**Common Misconceptions/Excuses**

1. **I'm not in CS, why do I need to learn?**

The world of technology is changing. Many jobs are starting to incorporate some form of coding in what they do. For example, a business analyst may need to pull data from a dataset, which requires a small understanding of coding. Although some jobs do not require coding, it is important to understand how programs work. I guarantee you that throughout the day, you often encounter some sort of coding, whether it be through using your laptop, or browsing Instagram.

2. **Only CS students get coding jobs.**

That is not true! Although many CS programs are amazing, I don't believe you need a CS degree to go into developing! Check out [CS DOJO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A). He is a Youtuber that goes through many coding questions and FAQs. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPO-9iMjBpc) explains that you don't need a CS degree to develop. Many of the best developers come from very diverse backgrounds! Don't ever give up!

3. **I don't know where to start**

Well today is your lucky day! I am here to provide resources and to assist you with learning how to code. **Some of these resources will be useful for students pursuing CS as well**

# The Basics

The first question you may want to ask yourself is "What is my goal?". This is because coding languages have different uses. Here is a small summary of what each language can do. Putting the most common languages for now.

Python:

# Resources

Lets start with some resources that can jump start your coding career.

**CodeAcademy**

I am a strong advocate for [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I have used it in various occasions and I feel that they provide strong resources for self learning. There are many languages that they offer, and I suggest starting from there.

**Telusko (Python)**

I have watched [Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/user/javaboynavin) on various occasions, particularly when I first started coding. OH MY! His youtube videos are very clear and he has a very strong understanding of Python. His playlist explains many data types and logic behind coding.
