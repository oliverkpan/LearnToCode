# Learn To Code by Oliver Pan

I created this repository to help students learn to code. I will be consistently updating it and providing resources whenever I can. I have a strong belief that anyone can code, and if you put your heart to it, and have a desire to learn, you'll be very successful in this coding journey. Please feel free to fork this repository and contribute!

**Why did I create this repo?**

A lot of the time, I get the question, "how do I learn to code"? Many of my peers feel that they cannot code, and won't ever be able to . That is not true. ANYONE CAN CODE, and you have to be willing to take the time and learn. Everyone starts from somewhere!

**Common Misconceptions/Excuses**

1. **I'm not in CS, why do I need to learn?**

The world of technology is changing. Many jobs are starting to incorporate some form of coding in what they do. For example, a business analyst may need to pull data from a dataset, which requires a small understanding of coding. Although some jobs do not require coding, it is important to understand how programs work. I guarantee you that throughout the day, you often encounter some sort of coding, whether it be through using your laptop, or browsing Instagram.

2. **Only CS students get coding jobs.**

That is not true! Although many CS programs are amazing, I don't believe you need a CS degree to go into developing! Check out [CS DOJO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A). He is a Youtuber that goes through many coding questions and FAQs. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPO-9iMjBpc) explains that you don't need a CS degree to develop. Many of the best developers come from very diverse backgrounds! Don't ever give up!

3. **I don't know where to start**

Well today is your lucky day! I am here to provide resources and to assist you with learning how to code. **Some of these resources will be useful for students pursuing CS as well**

# The Basics

The first question you may want to ask yourself is "What is my goal?". This is because coding languages have different uses. Here is a small summary of what each language can do. Putting the most common languages for now.

![alt text](https://github.com/oliverkpan/LearnToCode/blob/master/images/python.png) Python

I mainly use Python for various reasons. First, I am a data scientist/data-enthusiast. With Python, I am able to write machine learning programs, testing and training data. But back to basics, another reason that I really like Python is because it is a high-level programming language meaning that it isn't too hard to learn, and most coding beginners learn this as their first language. 
When I first started coding, I created many small projects, some that can be found on my Github. Python is very fun, easy to learn, and can be used for a variety of things.

Java is an interesting language. TBH, it is a little harder to understand, with all the syntax and coding format. However, it still is a very popular language and can be used for many reasons as well. If you are up for the challenge, you should try to learn Java. Many companies (SE positions) look for Java/C/C++ so I would suggest mastering this language to get a good shot for a Software Engineer Position.

![alt text](https://github.com/oliverkpan/LearnToCode/blob/master/images/sql.png) SQL

SQL is primary used for database management. Now there are many specifics with SQL, as well as the idea of relational databases vs. non-relational databases. I would suggest learning this language if you are interested in being a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or Business Systems Analyst

![alt text](https://github.com/oliverkpan/LearnToCode/blob/master/images/swift.png) Swift
  
Swift is mostly used for mobile development! With the use of XCode, you can write and create mobile apps, publishing them to the app store. Personally, I learned a bit of Swift using CodeAcademy, but I don't really use it. 

#### Other Languages I will add Later

C, C#, C++, PHP, Ruby, JS, HTML, CSS, and many more....






















# Resources

Lets start with some resources that can jump start your coding career.

**CodeAcademy**

I am a strong advocate for [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I have used it in various occasions and I feel that they provide strong resources for self learning. There are many languages that they offer, and I suggest starting from there.

**Telusko (Python)**

I have watched [Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/user/javaboynavin) on various occasions, particularly when I first started coding. OH MY! His youtube videos are very clear and he has a very strong understanding of Python. His playlist explains many data types and logic behind coding.
